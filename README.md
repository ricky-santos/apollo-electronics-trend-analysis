Apollo Electronics is an e-commerce company that sells consumer tech products online. They have gathered a wealth of data over the past few years and want to run an analysis of how their business has performed between 2019 and 2022. Apollo are interested in learning about general trends as well as what has impacted their sales across refunds, loyalty programs and apple products.

## Stakeholder Ask
"Hi data team - the leadership team is preparing for the company-wide town hall next month and would like to present a walkthrough of our order trends from 2019-2022. Can you help us answer the following:
* What were the overall trends in sales during this time?
* What were our monthly and yearly growth rates?
* How is the new loyalty program performing? Should we keep using it?
* What were our refund rates and average order value?

I'll set a meeting next week to review your findings - looking forward to discussing.

Thank you,

Angie"

**Stakeholder Follow-up** (After some claryfing questions)

* Focus on sales, average order value (AOV), and order count for growth rates
* For loyalty program performance, also look at average order value
* For refunds and average order value, would like to focus on how these metrics compare across Apple products. Also include number of refunds as a metric.

## High-Level Insights
* After the startup period in 2019 sales began to steadily increase. However, 2020 saw a major boost in sales in March coinciding with the beginnig of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.** Sales peaked in Q4 2020** at $3 million and have seen **overall declines in 2021 and 2022**.
* Thinkpad & Macbook Air Laptops as well as the Apple Airpods Heaphones contributed the most to sales accounting for **95% of revenue**.
* The refund window is exeedingly larger than normal with a refund window of **an average 738 days from shipping to refund** dates **subtracting 8% of sales revenue** over the 4 years so far.
* The loyalty program has grown over the years to account for around 50% of all orders. **Loyalty Members also have higher AOVs** than Guest Checkout.

* Sales have consistently increased during the holiday months of November and December, but this has been followed by declines in January and February as a result.
* Notably, October also experiences a drop in sales each year, which warrants further analysis to understand the cause.

## Product Analysis

https://github.com/ricky-santos/apollo-electronics-trend-analysis/blob/main/Charts-Images/Product%20Orders.png?raw=true
- The **Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, Macbook Air and Thinkpad Laptop** were the highest selling products earning **more than 95% of sales**.
- Comapred to the other Apple products, the iPhones lacked substantionally in product sales and orders accounting for less than 1% of overall sales.
- Purchases across most products occred on the **website earning $27 Million** over the four years compared to just **$800,000 on mobile**.
- The majority of orders attribute "direct" marketing as the main contributor to the sale accountign for **$23 million**. "Email" was the second with over $3 million.
- The Bose Soundsport Heaphones has contradicting performance to the above with all orders occuring on mobile and attributed to email marketing.

## Loyalty Program

</div>

Loyalty Program grew significantly with the covid bump. It accounted for more than half of orders by 2021, but stagnated ever since.

Guest Checkout's seem largely responsible for the boom in AOV in 2020 spending more per sale than loyalty members. After the boom, however, loyalty program members spend more on average than guest checkout. 

**Should Apollo continue the loyalty program?**

The loyalty program has improved over time, climbing in AOV through the years and accounting for roughly half of sales in 2021 and 2022. Ultimately, there is no reason to remove the loyalty program at this point. 

## Refund Analysis
- **Refund window was exeedingly long.** The average refund occured **738 days** after shipping. 
- **Apollo lost $3 Million in refunds** which accounts for **8%** of total sales revenue.*
- The Thinkpad (12%) and Macbook Air Laptops (11%) had the highest rates of return marking the laptops as the most common refunded items. Perhaps not so coincidentally, they were also responsible for the highest AOV for refunded orders ($1,099 and $1,588 respectively).

</div>

- Apple Products accounted for half of dollars refunded with the Macbook Air and Apple Airpods accounting for the majority of the refunds.
- The Macbook Air Laptop and the Apple iPhone had the second and third highest refund rates respectively.

*Available data only has refunds for purchases occuring up until July 2021 as no purchases made after that have refunds time-stamped befor the end of 2022. Refund losses account for 12% of sales up to July 2021.

 ## Recommendations:
- Focusing on efficiency and prioritizing markeion
- Loyalty Program
- Refund Policy
- Product Prioritization

### Notes on the Data
- A marginal amount of orders had null purchase dates
- refund dates only account for products purchsaed between 2019-2022.
