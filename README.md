Apollo Electronics is an e-commerce company founded in 2018 that sells consumer tech products online. They have gathered a wealth of data over the past few years and want to run an analysis of how their business has performed between 2019 and 2022. Apollo are interested in learning about general trends as well as what has impacted their sales across refunds, products and regions. They also want to know if the Loyalty Program is worth continuing.

* Sales have consistently increased during the holiday months of November and December, but this has been followed by declines in January and February as a result.
* Notably, October also experiences a drop in sales each year, which warrants further analysis to understand the cause.

</div>

- The **Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods, Macbook Air and Thinkpad Laptop** were the highest earning products earning **more than 95% of sales $**.
- The Apple Airpods were the most popular product overall with almost 50,000 orders which is double the next most popular product. The Samsung Chargepack was another notably popular product, but its smaller pricepoint meant that it did not contribute as much in sales.
- Comapred to the other Apple products, the iPhones lacked substantionally accounting for less than 1% of overall sales and orders.
- Purchases across most products occured on the **website earning $27 Million** over the four years compared to just **$800,000 on mobile**.
- The majority of orders attribute "direct" marketing as the main contributor to the sale which accounted for **$23 million**. "Email" was the second with over $3 million.
- The Bose Soundsport Heaphones has contradicting performance to the above with all orders occuring on mobile and attributed to email marketing.

## Loyalty Program

</div>

Loyalty Program grew significantly with the covid bump. It accounted for more than half of orders by 2021, but stagnated ever since.

Guest Checkout's seem largely responsible for the boom in AOV in 2020 spending more per sale than loyalty members. After the boom, however, loyalty program members spend more on average than guest checkout. 

**Should Apollo continue the loyalty program?**

The loyalty program has improved over time, climbing in AOV through the years and accounting for roughly half of sales in 2021 and 2022. Ultimately, there is no reason to remove the loyalty program at this point. 

## Refund Analysis
- **Refund window was exeedingly long.** The average refund occured **738 days** after shipping. 
- **Apollo lost $3 Million in refunds** which accounts for **8%** of total sales revenue.*
- The Thinkpad (12%) and Macbook Air Laptops (11%) had the highest rates of return marking the laptops as the most commonly refunded items. Perhaps not suprisingly, they were also responsible for the highest AOV for refunded orders ($1,099 and $1,588 respectively).

</div>

- Apple Products accounted for half of dollars refunded with the Macbook Air and Apple Airpods accounting for the majority of the refunds.
- The Macbook Air Laptop and the Apple iPhone had the second and third highest overall refund rates respectively.

*Available data only has refunds for purchases occuring up until July 2021 as no purchases made after that have refunds time-stamped befor the end of 2022. Refund losses account for 12% of sales up to July 2021.

## Regional Analysis
North America accounted for half of sales and orders with EMEA (29%), APAC (12%) and LATAM (7%) accounting for the rest. All regions followed the same general trend lines for sales and orders.

 ## Recommendations:
 The pandemic bump was drastic and Apollo was not able to sustain its growth, but a few opportuninties could help the company push for the future.
 
- There have been no new product offering introduced into the lineup since the Beats Soundsport Headphones and the Samsung Webcam in 2020. Laptops contribute to high sales dollars but highly priced items also have the highest return rates. The Apple Airpods were excellent performers given their relatively low return rates and high sales contributions.
- The Loyalty Program has been showing signs of improvement in 2022. Continuing the program would allow us to collect more data.
- The refund window is unusually long and customers are taking advatage of it. If this policy is a marketing measure, perhaps consider reducinng the window significantly while still being generous to see how it impacts return rates and AOV.


### Notes on the Data
- A marginal amount of orders had null purchase dates.
- Refund dates only account for products purchsaed between 2019-2022.
